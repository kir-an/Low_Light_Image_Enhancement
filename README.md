# Low_Light_Image_Enhancement
This python script is based on the implementation concenpt of haze removal from Zhiming Tan Et al. [Research Paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Fast-Single-image-Defogging-Tan-Bai/64caa24f2cb3fff6d8eb966f90078f0d0b8a7db0?p2df)

## Image Enhancement Technique
The whole technique is based on three steps,

  1.Inverting the low light image<br />
  2.Applying the Haze Removal technique on the inverted image<br />
  3.Invert the enhanced image<br />
## Haze Removal
The removal part comprises of three steps,

  1.Determine the intensity of atmospheric light. *<br />
  2.Estimate transmission map.<br />
  3.Clarify image.<br />
  
   This in our case is constant which is 255, obtain from experimenting on multiple images. This will be updated so that it is calculated through a function. Si nce it was taking too long to compute this value it is better to find the average value of a batch.


Intensity of atmospheric light <code>A</code> is estimated form hazed image <code>I(x)</code> Transmission map <code>t(x)</code> is estimated using <code>A</code> and <code>I(x)</code> Image is clarified with the image defogging model

### Estimate intensity of atmospheric light:
Finding the top 0.1% brightest pixels in the dark channel then choose one with highest intensity as the representing of atmospheric light. This part is not needed in our case and thus ignored

### Estimate transmission map:
Find a dark channel based on a local area(coarsemap) Then, the transmission map <code>t(x)</code> is thereby obtained:

<code>t(x) = 1 â€“ defoggingParam * darkPixelFromCoarseMap / AtmosphericLightIntensity</code>

The <code>defoggingParam</code> is a value between 0 to 1. The higher value the lesser amount of fog would be kept for the distant objects.

### Clarify image:
The image is clarified by:<code> J(x)=(I(x)- A)/max(t(x), t0)+A</code>

Where <code>J(x)</code> is output, <code>I(x)</code> is input,<code> t(x) </code>is transmission map, A is atmospheric light and t0 is set to a constant value to avoid dividing by zero.

## Usage:
Currently, the user has to specify the input image and output image path in a main() function. Next update will use console arguments to specify the image path. Feel free to add new things to the code and pull a merge request.
